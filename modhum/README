# Getting this error from bcftools:
    [W::vcf_parse] FILTER 'LowQual' is not defined in the header

# To fix this problem, I'm using the altai.sed and doaltai.sh scripts,
# which are documented in the orig directory. For this run, I modified 
# so that the output is compressed using bgzip.

    ls *.mod.vcf.gz | xargs -P 10 -n 1 bash doaltai.sh

# After running this, I have files with names like xxx-fixed.vcf.bgz, which bcftools
# will read without reporting errors.

# Remove originals
    rm *.mod.vcf.gz *.mod.vcf.gz.tbi

    ls *.vcf.bgz | grep -v X | grep -v MT | grep -v Y | grep -v nonchrom > autosomes

# filter
cat autosomes | tr ".-" " " | awk '{print $1, $3}' | xargs -P 15 -n 2 bash filter.sh

# Oops! My filter.sh file combines conditions with "&" rather than "|". I'll
# need to re-do. Should be much faster, because I won't need to refer to the
